                    <p>This project centers around the dataset “Data on major power outage events in the continental U.S.” compiled by Mukherjee et al., 2018 in order to identify and understand the most impactful characteristics that are associated with power outage severity and use them to predict future severity.</p>

                    <h3>Developing Environmentally-Aware Algorithms to Recommend Virtual Machine Migration</h3>
                    <p>This project develops two forecasting techniques that consider emissions patterns to recommend to cloud computing users optimal times to migrate cloud resources. Algorithms were trained on cloud computing center data provided by Microsoft Azure as well as historic emissions from WattimeAPI.</p>

                    <p>Utilized U.S EPA's Smart Location Dataset to analyze Californian areas' relationships between the EPA-rated Walkability (an aggregate index for traffic, access to public transit, and accessibility of labor), wage, and car ownership, modeling it with regression.</p>

                    <p>Compiled sales data of my workplace over the past 16 months in Python pandas, cleaned the data to arrange it into tidy format, and generated summary statistics and visualizations to showcase demand trends and possible expansions. Also trained an ARIMA model for demand forecasting.</p>
