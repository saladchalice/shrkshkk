                    <h3>Power Outages: Predicting Severity and Evaluating Causes</h3>
                    <p>This project centers around the dataset “Data on major power outage events in the continental U.S.” compiled by Mukherjee et al., 2018 in order to identify and understand the most impactful characteristics that are associated with power outage severity and use them to predict future severity.</p>

                    <h3>Developing Environmentally-Aware Algorithms to Recommend Virtual Machine Migration</h3>
                    <p>This project develops two forecasting techniques that consider emissions patterns to recommend to cloud computing users optimal times to migrate cloud resources. Algorithms were trained on cloud computing center data provided by Microsoft Azure as well as historic emissions from WattimeAPI.</p>

                    <h3>Impacts of Urban Walkability and Wage on Car Ownership in California</h3>
                    <p>Utilized U.S EPA's Smart Location Dataset to analyze Californian areas' relationships between the EPA-rated Walkability (an aggregate index for traffic, access to public transit, and accessibility of labor), wage, and car ownership, modeling it with regression.</p>

                    <h3>Structural Topic Analysis of Race-Related Discourse in South African SOTN Speeches</h3>
                    <p>Utilized structural topic modeling techniques in RStudio to evaluate trends in topical frequency and significance across all State of the Nation addresses since 1994. Analyzed and tracked topics heavily interlinked with racial discourse and post-apartheid reform to discover their evolution over time.</p>

                    <h3>General Store Co-Op Financial Performance and Forecasting</h3>
                    <p>Compiled sales data of my workplace over the past 16 months in Python pandas, cleaned the data to arrange it into tidy format, and generated summary statistics and visualizations to showcase demand trends and possible expansions. Also trained an ARIMA model for demand forecasting.</p>

                    <h3>XGBoost Credit Card Fraud Classifier</h3>
                    <p>Implements and trains an XGBoost machine learning algorithm in Python with the XGBoost package to classify financial transaction data as fraudulent or legitimate based on factors such as transaction time, category, merchant, amount, etc.</p>
