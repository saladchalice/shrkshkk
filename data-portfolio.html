                    <p>This project centers around the dataset “Data on major power outage events in the continental U.S.” compiled by Mukherjee et al., 2018 in order to identify and understand the most impactful characteristics that are associated with power outage severity and use them to predict future severity.</p>

                    <p>This project develops two forecasting techniques that consider emissions patterns to recommend to cloud computing users optimal times to migrate cloud resources. Algorithms were trained on cloud computing center data provided by Microsoft Azure as well as historic emissions from WattimeAPI.</p>
