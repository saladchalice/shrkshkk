I'm currently a fourth-year student at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Business Economics and minoring in Data Science. i was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and have since lived in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), Austin (Texas), and San Diego (California). for fun, i like to paint, learn languages (studying french for 7 years now!), and captain two recreational soccer teams at UCSD.</p>
