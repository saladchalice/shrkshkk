            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>hi! my name is Eddie Lu. I'm currently a fourth-year student at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Business Economics and minoring in Data Science. i was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and have since lived in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), Austin (Texas), and San Diego (California). for fun, i like to paint, learn languages (studying french for 7 years now!), and captain two intramural soccer teams at UCSD.</p>
            <h2>my art</h2>
            <p>i like drawing landscapes and portraits. generally i sketch nature and environments, but my biggest projects are my digital paintings. drawing just for a hobby right now, but trying to set up commissions!</p>
            <h2>data science</h2>
            <p>in addition to making art, i'm very passionate about analyzing and visualizing data to create data-driven insights.</p>
